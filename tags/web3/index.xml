      <description>Substrate is a software framework for building blockchain systems. A substrate blockchain is written in Rust and compiled into WebAssembly so that it could run safely on nodes across different operation systems.
WasmEdge is a leading WebAssembly Runtime for cloud-native applications. It is an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation / Cloud-native foundation. Through a generous grant from the web3 foundation, we are happy to preview a version of substrate framework that runs on the WasmEdge runtime.</description>

      <description>Polkadot’s founder, Dr. Gavin Wood, is one of the original architects of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Dr. Wood, the co-author of “Mastering Ethereum”, is also the author of the Ethereum yellow paper; a formal definition of the Ethereum protocol (in mathematical terms), which also provides an in-depth explanation of how the EVM actually works.
Some may be aware that the Polkadot ecosystem did not initially come with a Turing-complete virtual machine like the EVM.</description>

      <description>(02/28/2020, Austin TX USA)The Web3 Foundation has awarded Second State, a leading cloud and blockchain infrastructure company, a grant to bring the Ethereum flavored WebAssembly (Ewasm) virtual machine to the Polkadot ecosystem. Get this project from GitHub here: https://github.com/second-state/substrate-ewasm
The virtual machine is a key infrastructure component for public blockchains. It allows any user from the public to submit untrusted code to the blockchain platform, in the form of smart contracts, and pay for its execution based on resource consumption.</description>
