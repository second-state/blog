      <title>Polkadot is getting WebAssembly-based Ethereum 2.0 virtual machine from Second State</title>

      <description>Polkadot’s founder, Dr. Gavin Wood, is one of the original architects of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Dr. Wood, the co-author of “Mastering Ethereum”, is also the author of the Ethereum yellow paper; a formal definition of the Ethereum protocol (in mathematical terms), which also provides an in-depth explanation of how the EVM actually works.
Some may be aware that the Polkadot ecosystem did not initially come with a Turing-complete virtual machine like the EVM.</description>

      <description>(02/28/2020, Austin TX USA)The Web3 Foundation has awarded Second State, a leading cloud and blockchain infrastructure company, a grant to bring the Ethereum flavored WebAssembly (Ewasm) virtual machine to the Polkadot ecosystem. Get this project from GitHub here: https://github.com/second-state/substrate-ewasm
The virtual machine is a key infrastructure component for public blockchains. It allows any user from the public to submit untrusted code to the blockchain platform, in the form of smart contracts, and pay for its execution based on resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Diving into Ethereum&#39;s Virtual Machine(EVM): the future of Ewasm</title>

      <description>Ethereum is a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language. It allows anyone to create a decentralised application, by making use of Ethereum smart contracts.
 “The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution” (Antonopoulos and Wood, 2018).
 The EVM consists of a stack-based architecture. In order for a smart contract to be deployed, all high level Ethereum smart contract code must first be compiled into machine-readable code (called bytecode).</description>

      <description>Second State provides open source infrastructure technologies for public and enterprise blockchains. The smart contract compiler toolchain and virtual machine runtimes are critical elements of the infrastructure.
Through its web-based BUIDL IDE, developers can easily access Second State smart contract programming languages, compilers, optimizers, and virtual machines. Even novice developers can write and publish decentralized applications (smart contract + web app) on any Ethereum-compatible blockchain in minutes. See examples on Ethereum Classic and CyberMiles blockchains.</description>

      <description>The Ethereum Foundation Devcon is the most important annual gathering of developers, designers, and researchers in the Ethereum ecosystem. This year’s Devcon5 in Osaka, Japan is the 5th Devcon, and as in past years, it is a bellwether of what to come in Ethereum.
Note: My company, Second State, was invited to give a talk at Devcon5, where we showed off the world&#39;s first toolchain to compile and deploy Solidity smart contracts on the official Ewasm testnet.</description>

      <description>Second State, a developer of an open source blockchain smart contract platform for enterprises was shortlisted in the Qualcomm Innovate in Taiwan Challenge – 2019. They proposed to optimize the popular WebAssemly virtual machine technology with customized chip solutions. The chip-accelerated WebAssemly virtual machine is then applied to the blockchain to efficiently execute smart contracts. So to develop a &amp;ldquo;blockchain chip&amp;rdquo; that is truly valuable and meaningful.
 Qualcomm, a smartphone chip maker, recently hosted the Qualcomm Innovate in Taiwan Challenge – 2019, and selected 10 teams out of over 100 teams as finalists.</description>
