      <description>Second State has recently released a developer preview of its Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), known as Second State Functions. The Second State Functions enables developers to write simple functions in the Rust programming language for computationally intensive tasks such as image processing and AI inference. The developer simply needs to upload the compiled function to the FaaS service, and the function will become publically available as a web service. The developer preview version of the Second State Functions is free to use.</description>

Internet privacy is broken The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), invented over 40 years ago, has been the bed rock for security and privacy on the Internet. While PKI algorithms are behind the most internet security protocols, such as HTTPS and TLS, the idea for individuals to use public keys to exchange data, (eg, PGP), was not adopted in large scale.</description>

      <description>The Rust programming language is gaining popularity amongst developers. For 5 years in a row, it is voted as the most beloved programming language in the world. In the most recent 2020 survey of 65,000 developers, Rust was beloved by a stunning 86.1% of developers. Being loved by developers is a leading indicator that Rust is on the path of mass adoption. It is entering a positive feedback cycle of more developers, more libraries, better tools, larger talent pool, more adoption, and then more developers.</description>

      <description>Second State joins the Microsoft for Startups program to develop and commercialize the next generation software infrastructure for cloud computing. With Microsoft for Startups, Second State will create open source software frameworks and developer tools for the cloud and for blockchains based on the WebAssembly technology.
WebAssembly was originally created as a high-performance execution engine for web browsers. As it becomes increasingly popular in the developer community, WebAssembly is moving from the client-side to the server-side, powering the next generation cloud services.</description>

      <description>Polkadot’s founder, Dr. Gavin Wood, is one of the original architects of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Dr. Wood, the co-author of “Mastering Ethereum”, is also the author of the Ethereum yellow paper; a formal definition of the Ethereum protocol (in mathematical terms), which also provides an in-depth explanation of how the EVM actually works.
Some may be aware that the Polkadot ecosystem did not initially come with a Turing-complete virtual machine like the EVM.</description>

      <description>An open source WebAssembly runtime optimized for blockchain, AI, and cloud services
(12/17/2019, Taipei)The Second State team has released a “developer preview” of the Second State Virtual Machine (SSVM). It is a WebAssembly (Wasm) compatible runtime engineered from ground up for server side applications. Get it from Github here: https://github.com/second-state/SSVM
Wasm started as a high performance execution engine inside web browsers. It is language agnostic (supporting popular new languages such as Rust), platform agnostic, lightweight, fast, and also provides native hardware access through its modular security model.</description>

      <description>WebAssembly (Wasm), originally invented and developed by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and others at W3C; is a high-performance execution engine for in-browser web applications. As it gains popularity on the client-side, Wasm is also becoming a serious contender as a server-side technology.
Value propositions of WebAssembly Wasm’s move from client-side to server-side follows well-traveled paths of previous generations of technologies such as Java and JavaScript. Compared with existing solutions, Wasm offers some compelling value propositions on the server-side.</description>
