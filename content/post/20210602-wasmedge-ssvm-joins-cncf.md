We are thrilled to announce that WasmEdge, formerly SSVM, has recently been accepted by the CNCF Foundation as a sandbox project, which is the first offcial CNCF WebAssembly runtime project. We envision that it will fill an important role in CNCFâ€™s open source cloud computing landscape as a mission critical lightweight runtime for edge clouds.
