Today Second State, together with Oasis foundation, is announcing the most exciting community event to date, and a chance for community members to earn some of the largest rewards Oasis foundation has ever offered. Last week Oasis network launched [Mainnet Beta](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/the-oasis-network-starting-a-new-era-for-blockchain-100c6ef56373), and we released Second State’s [Oasis Ethereum ParaTime](https://www.oasiseth.org/). 

The ParaTime’s powerful design and technology means the Oasis Ethereum ParaTime is:

* Completely backward compatible with Ethereum with support for the entire Solidity toolchain, allowing it to support DApps currently on the Ethereum network.
* Much more performant than Ethereum with throughput order of magnitude higher and only 6s confirmation times.
* Cheaper than Ethereum, with gas fees that are less than 1% of those on Ethereum — making using and running DApps on the Oasis Network much more affordable.
* An easy-to-use web-based development environment that makes it easy to build and deploy smart contracts.

To showcase Second State’s support for Ethereum, we’re partnering on a new Community Hackathon! 

Simply complete a series of challenges on the Second State Oasis Ethereum ParaTime between October 12th and October 23rd and submit your results for a chance to win ROSE token rewards. You could earn up to 30,150 ROSE tokens.
