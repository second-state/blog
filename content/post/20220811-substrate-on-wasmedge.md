Substrate is a software framework for building blockchain systems. A substrate blockchain is written in Rust and compiled into WebAssembly so that it could run safely on nodes across different operation systems. 

WasmEdge is a leading WebAssembly Runtime for cloud-native applications. It is an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation / Cloud-native foundation. Through a generous grant from the web3 foundation, we are happy to preview a version of substrate framework that runs on the WasmEdge runtime.
