Halloween is finally here! Are you ready for the spookiest night of the year?

[BUIDL IDE  tools](https://secondstate.io/buidl) now has an upgraded UI just for Halloween. Trick or treat! A spooky pumpkin on the top welcomes you to the BUIDL’s Halloween.

Now, for developers, can you tell what the following code is for?

```
pragma lity ^1.2.4;

contract Halloween {
    
  function greet() pure public returns (string) {
    return "Happy Halloween";
  }
}
```

This is a very simple (yet spooky) smart contract example, just like the “Hello World” on the internet.

Let’s figure out how it works.

### Start coding

#### Step 1

Open the BUIDL IDE tool in any browser. http://buidl.secondstate.io/

#### Step 2

Check the **Providers** tab on the left panel. The icon, if green, means BUIDL IDE is connected to the Second State DevChain. Please refresh the page if the icon is red.

#### Step 3

*3.1* Clear the content in the **contract** editor section of BUIDL.

*3.2* Copy and paste the following code to the **contract** section 

```
pragma lity ^1.2.4;

contract Halloween {
    
  function greet() pure public returns (string) {
    return "Happy Halloween";
  }
}
```

*3.3* Click on **Compile** and you will see the following. Then click on **deploy on chain**.

The contract is now deployed on the DevChain, and you could see the Contract Name , TX and Address on the left tab. (TX records this transaction and it is unique. So is the contract address.)

*3.4* Now click open the **Halloween** contract, and click on the **Call** button to call its `greeting()` function. In the LOG window, you will see “Happy Halloween”.

That’s it. Happy Halloween on the blockchain!
